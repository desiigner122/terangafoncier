### **Issue 2: Admin User Not Authenticated**

**Files Created:**

**What to Do:**

**Option A: Login with Existing Admin**
1. Go to https://www.terangafoncier.sn/login
2. Login with your admin credentials
3. Access https://www.terangafoncier.sn/admin/dashboard/leads

**Option B: Create New Admin User**
1. Supabase → Authentication → Users → Add User
2. Fill email (e.g., `admin@terangafoncier.sn`) and password
3. Copy the User ID
4. In SQL Editor, run the INSERT command from `ADMIN_ACCESS_SETUP.md`
5. This creates the profile with `role='admin'` and `user_type='administrateur'`
6. Login to frontend
7. Access admin dashboard

**Expected Result:** ✅ Admin user can access `/admin/dashboard/leads`

## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Flow**

### **Phase 1: Fix RLS (Enable Contact Form)**

```
1. User submits form on /blockchain-contact
   ↓
2. MarketingService.createLead() runs
   ↓
3. Supabase tries to insert into marketing_leads
   ↓
4a. ❌ RLS Policy blocks it (currently)
4b. ✅ RLS Policy allows it (after fix)
   ↓
5. Lead is saved to database
   ↓
6. Admin can see it in dashboard
```

**Timeline:** Run `DIAGNOSE_AND_FIX_RLS.sql` → Test form → Done ✅

---

### **Phase 2: Verify Admin Access (See Leads in Dashboard)**

```
1. User goes to /admin/dashboard/leads
   ↓
2. AdminRoute checks if user is authenticated as admin
   ↓
3a. ❌ User not admin (currently) → Redirect to /dashboard
3b. ✅ User is admin (after setup) → Load leads page
   ↓
4. Admin dashboard displays all leads
   ↓
5. Admin can click eye icon to see all fields
   ↓
6. Admin can manage leads (update status, assign, add notes)
```

**Timeline:** Create admin account → Login → Access dashboard → Done ✅
