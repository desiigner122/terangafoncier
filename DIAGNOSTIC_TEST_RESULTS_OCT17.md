# üî¥ TEST RESULTS: Critical Issues Found

**Test Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ‚ùå BUYER CANNOT SEE ACCEPTED REQUESTS  
**Root Causes:** 2 Critical Issues Identified

---

## üìä Test Summary

### **Scenario Tested:**
1. Seller (heritage.fall@teranga-foncier.sn) logged in - VendeurPurchaseRequests page
2. Buyer (family.diallo@teranga-foncier.sn) logged in - ParticulierMesAchats page
3. Both pages open in separate browser tabs with F12 console

### **Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Seller has 3 purchase_cases
- ‚úÖ Buyer has 2 requests (pending)
- ‚úÖ Buyer has 2 transactions (pending)
- ‚ùå **Buyer has 0 purchase_cases** ‚Üê THIS IS THE PROBLEM

### **Data Visibility:**

```
SELLER SIDE (WORKING):
‚úÖ [VENDEUR] Purchase cases trouv√©es: 3
‚úÖ [VENDEUR] Transactions charg√©es: 4

BUYER SIDE (BROKEN):
‚úÖ [LOAD] Requests loaded: 2
‚úÖ [LOAD] Transactions loaded: 2
‚ùå [LOAD] Purchase cases loaded: 0  ‚Üê ZERO!
```

## üî¥ Issue #1: Real-time Subscription Initialization Error

### **Symptom:**
```
üü¢ [REALTIME] Subscription status: CLOSED
üü¢ [REALTIME] Subscription status: CHANNEL_ERROR
```

The subscription channel is **immediately closing with CHANNEL_ERROR** instead of staying open.

### **Root Cause:**
Incorrect Supabase API usage in cleanup function. The code was calling `supabase.removeChannel()` which doesn't exist in the current Supabase SDK, and then trying to unsubscribe later.

### **Error Message:**
```
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: channel.unsubscribe is not a function
```

### **Status:**
‚úÖ **FIXED in commit 60245a40**
- Changed from `supabase.removeChannel()` to `channel().unsubscribe()`
- Added proper error handling with try/catch
- Made cleanup function async

### **Code Changes:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (broken):
return () => {
  supabase.removeChannel('buyer-requests-${buyerId}');
  // This removeChannel doesn't exist!
};

// AFTER (fixed):
return async () => {
  await supabase.channel(`buyer-requests-${buyerId}`).unsubscribe();
  // Proper unsubscribe call
};
```

## üî¥ Issue #2: Buyer Cannot Query purchase_cases Table

### **Symptom:**
```
‚úÖ [LOAD] Purchase cases loaded: 0
üìä [LOAD] Purchase case map: Object { }
```

The buyer's query returns **zero rows** even though:
- Seller has 3 purchase_cases
- These belong to requests that the buyer made
- The request IDs are correct

### **Root Cause:**
**Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies** - The `purchase_cases` table likely has RLS enabled but NO policy allowing buyers to read their own cases.

### **Why It's Happening:**
In Supabase, when RLS is enabled without explicit allow policies, ALL queries are blocked by default. The seller can see them because they're the creator, but the buyer cannot access them.

### **The Missing RLS Policy:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Buyers can read their own purchase_cases"
  ON public.purchase_cases
  FOR SELECT
  USING (buyer_id = auth.uid());
```

### **Status:**
‚è≥ **READY TO APPLY** - See file: `FIX_RLS_PURCHASE_CASES.sql`

### **SQL Fix Provided:**
```sql
-- Enable RLS (if not already)
ALTER TABLE public.purchase_cases ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Add policies:
CREATE POLICY "Buyers can read their own purchase_cases"
  ON public.purchase_cases
  FOR SELECT
  USING (buyer_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Sellers can read their own purchase_cases"
  ON public.purchase_cases
  FOR SELECT
  USING (seller_id = auth.uid());

-- etc.
```

## üü° Issue #3: Real-time Callback Not Being Triggered

### **Status:**
üü¢ **SECONDARY ISSUE** - Will be resolved once Issue #1 is fixed

### **Current Observation:**
We don't see the critical log:
```
üü¢ [REALTIME] CALLBACK TRIGGERED!
```

This is because:
1. The subscription is getting CHANNEL_ERROR (Issue #1) ‚Üê Being fixed now
2. The buyer can't see purchase_cases anyway (Issue #2)

### **After Fixes:**
1. Subscription will stay open
2. Buyer will see purchase_cases
3. When seller accepts, the callback should fire
4. Buyer's request will move to "Accept√©es" tab

---

## üîß Next Steps

### **Phase 1: Apply Fixes (Now)**

**Step 1:** Already done - Commit 60245a40 fixes real-time subscription
```
‚úÖ RealtimeSyncService.js - Fixed cleanup function
‚úÖ Git commit: 60245a40
```

**Step 2:** Apply RLS Policy Fix to Supabase
1. Go to Supabase Console ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Execute: `FIX_RLS_PURCHASE_CASES.sql`
3. Verify no errors

### **Phase 2: Retry Test (15 minutes)**

After applying the SQL fix:

```bash
1. Stop the dev server
2. Restart: npm run dev
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
4. Login both users again
5. Repeat test:
   - Seller: Accept request
   - Buyer: Check for üü¢ [REALTIME] CALLBACK TRIGGERED!
   - Buyer: Check console for purchase_cases > 0
   - Buyer: Check if request moved to "Accept√©es" tab
```

### **Phase 3: Measure Success**

**Test Passes If:**
- ‚úÖ `üü¢ [REALTIME] CALLBACK TRIGGERED!` appears in buyer console
- ‚úÖ `‚úÖ [LOAD] Purchase cases loaded: 1` (or more) appears
- ‚úÖ The request moves to "Accept√©es" tab in real-time
- ‚úÖ No CHANNEL_ERROR in subscription logs

---

## üìã Files Changed

### **Committed (Commit 60245a40):**
- `src/services/RealtimeSyncService.js`
  - Both `subscribeToBuyerRequests()` and `subscribeToVendorRequests()` cleanup functions
  - Changed `removeChannel()` ‚Üí `channel().unsubscribe()`

### **Ready to Apply:**
- `FIX_RLS_PURCHASE_CASES.sql` ‚Üê Execute in Supabase SQL editor

### **Test Results Document:**
- This file: `DIAGNOSTIC_TEST_RESULTS_OCT17.md`

## üìà Impact Assessment

### **Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL
- Breaks entire buyer workflow
- Buyers cannot see accepted requests
- Real-time sync completely non-functional

### **Effort to Fix:** ‚ö° LOW (15 minutes)
- 1 SQL command (RLS policy)
- Already implemented code fix (commit 60245a40)
- Just need to apply to database

### **Testing Required:** ‚úÖ YES
- Need to retry acceptance flow
- Need to verify callback fires
- Need to verify purchase_cases appear

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

This fix is complete when:

| Criterion | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Buyer purchase_cases query | 0 rows | N rows (>0) |
| Real-time subscription | CHANNEL_ERROR | SUBSCRIBED |
| Callback triggering | Never fires | Fires on accept |
| Acceptance sync | ‚ùå Broken | ‚úÖ Working |
| Request tab move | Stays in pending | Moves to accepted |

---

## üìû Quick Reference

**RLS Policy Issue Symptoms:**
- Query returns 0 rows even though data exists
- Other users can see the same data
- Error message might not appear (just empty result)
- Happens at row level, not table level

**Real-time Subscription Error Symptoms:**
- CHANNEL_ERROR status
- Callback never fires
- `unsubscribe is not a function` errors
- Subscription closes immediately

**How to Verify Fix:**
1. Check Supabase RLS policies:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'purchase_cases';
   ```
2. Check subscription in browser console:
   - Should see: `üü¢ [REALTIME] Subscription established successfully`
   - Should NOT see: `CHANNEL_ERROR`
