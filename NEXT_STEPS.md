## 🎯 3-Step Deployment Plan

### Step 1: Add Route to App (5 min)

**File to edit**: `src/App.jsx`

**What to do**:
```javascript
// Add this import at the top with other page imports
import CRMPageNew from '@/pages/CRM/CRMPageNew';

// Add this route in your Routes section
<Route path="/crm" element={<CRMPageNew />} />

// Alternative: To keep old CRM too
<Route path="/crm/new" element={<CRMPageNew />} />
```

**How to verify**:
- Save file (auto-reload in dev server)
- Go to `http://localhost:5173/crm`
- Should see CRM dashboard with 4 tabs

---

### Step 2: Run Full Test Suite (30 min)

**Follow**: `CRM_TESTING_GUIDE.md`

**Quick checklist**:
