## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Route Integration (5 minutes)

#### Option A: Replace Old CRM
```javascript
// In your App.jsx or main router

// BEFORE:
import CRMPage from '@/pages/CRM/CRMPage';
// ...
<Route path="/crm" element={<CRMPage />} />

// AFTER:
import CRMPageNew from '@/pages/CRM/CRMPageNew';
// ...
<Route path="/crm" element={<CRMPageNew />} />
```

#### Option B: Run Both (Recommended for testing)
```javascript
// In your App.jsx or main router
import CRMPage from '@/pages/CRM/CRMPage';
import CRMPageNew from '@/pages/CRM/CRMPageNew';

// Old CRM at original URL
<Route path="/crm" element={<CRMPage />} />

// New CRM at new URL
<Route path="/crm/new" element={<CRMPageNew />} />
```

### Phase 2: Testing in Dev Environment (30 minutes)

1. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the CRM:
   - If Option A: `http://localhost:5173/crm`
   - If Option B: `http://localhost:5173/crm/new`

3. Run through **CRM_TESTING_GUIDE.md** checklist

4. Verify all functionality works

### Phase 3: Production Deployment

#### For Vercel/Netlify:
```bash
# Commit and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "🚀 Deploy: New CRM system to production"
git push origin main

# Deployment happens automatically
```

#### For Other Hosting:
1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the `dist/` folder to your hosting

3. Verify the route is working in production
