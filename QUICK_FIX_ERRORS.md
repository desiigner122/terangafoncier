## 🤔 Why This Happened

The error happened because:
1. Your React app tries to use 5 new tables
2. These tables didn't exist yet in Supabase
3. REST API can't query non-existent tables

## 🎯 What Gets Created

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `purchase_case_participants` | Team members on each case |
| `purchase_case_fees` | Fees & costs tracking |
| `purchase_case_tasks` | Task assignments |
| `purchase_case_documents` | Document management |
| `purchase_case_timeline` | Audit trail |

---

## ❓ Got Errors After Running SQL?

### Error: "Table already exists"
→ That's OK! Tables are created. Reload browser.

### Error: "INSERT INTO auth.users..."
→ This is a schema permission issue. Don't worry, it happens at end. All tables are created.

### Still seeing errors after reload?
→ Clear browser cache:
- Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
- Mac: Cmd+Shift+Delete
- Then go to your app URL

---

## ✨ After This Works

All these features now work:
- ✅ Case tracking (6-phase workflow)
- ✅ Participant management  
- ✅ Fee tracking
- ✅ Task assignments
- ✅ Document uploads

**Enjoy your production-ready system!** 🎉
