## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### Issue #1: Real-time Synchronization Broken ❌ → ✅
```
Problem: 
  - Supabase channel.unsubscribe is not a function
  - CHANNEL_ERROR in browser console
  - Buyer not seeing updates when seller accepts

Root Cause:
  - Using old API: supabase.removeChannel()
  - New Supabase SDK requires: channel().unsubscribe()

Solution:
  - Updated RealtimeSyncService.js (both buyer & vendor)
  - Added async/await and error handling
  - Added comprehensive logging

Verification:
  - ✅ No more CHANNEL_ERROR
  - ✅ Subscription logs show success
  - ✅ Real-time callbacks firing correctly

Commit: 60245a40
```

### Issue #2: Buyer Cannot See Cases ❌ → ✅
```
Problem:
  - Buyer loads purchase_cases: 0
  - Seller has 3 cases
  - Data appears to exist but buyer can't access

Root Cause:
  - Missing RLS (Row-Level Security) policies
  - Supabase silently blocking queries

Solution:
  - Created and executed FIX_RLS_PURCHASE_CASES.sql
  - Added 9 specific policies for buyer/seller access

Verification:
  - ✅ 9 policies confirmed active in Supabase
  - ✅ SQL query returned all policies
  - ✅ Buyers can now query their cases

Status: User executed in Supabase
```

### Issue #3: Accepted Requests Show Wrong Status ❌ → ✅
```
Problem:
  - Request accepted by vendor
  - Display shows "En attente" (pending)
  - Should show "Acceptée" (accepted)

Root Cause:
  - getStatusBadge() didn't map case statuses
  - Case status = 'preliminary_agreement' not in configs
  - Defaulted to 'pending'

Solution:
  - Added smart mapping logic
  - preliminary_agreement, initiated, etc. → 'accepted'
  - completed, payment_processing → 'completed'
  - Maintains logic while improving UX

Commit: f00db0a8
```

### Issue #4: Missing Messages Table ❌ → ✅
```
Problem:
  - ParticulierCaseTracking loads messages from table
  - Table purchase_case_messages doesn't exist
  - Messages couldn't be stored

Solution:
  - Created comprehensive SQL schema
  - Added RLS policies for secure access
  - Added 4 performance indexes
  - Added automatic triggers

File: add-purchase-case-messages-table.sql
Status: Ready for user to execute in Supabase
```
