# ✅ RLS POLICIES VERIFIED & CREATED

**Date:** October 17, 2025

9. ✅ `Sellers can view their cases` - Redundant but good

## 🚀 NOW: Execute Final Test

### Step 1: Restart Dev Server (30 seconds)

```bash
# Terminal: Kill current server
Ctrl+C

# Wait 2 seconds

# Terminal: Restart
npm run dev

# Wait for:
# ✅ VITE v... ready in ... ms
# ✅ Local: http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache (30 seconds)

```bash
# In ANY browser tab:
Ctrl+Shift+Delete  (Windows/Linux)
Cmd+Shift+Delete   (Mac)

# Select:
✓ Cookies and other site data
✓ Cached images and files

# Click: Clear data
```

### Step 3: Reopen Browser Tabs Side-by-Side

**Tab A - Seller:**
- URL: http://localhost:5173/login
- Email: heritage.fall@teranga-foncier.sn
- Password: (use your usual password)
- Navigate to: Demandes (Vendor Purchase Requests)
- F12 → Console tab → Keep open

**Tab B - Buyer:**
- URL: http://localhost:5173/login
- Email: family.diallo@teranga-foncier.sn
- Password: (use your usual password)
- Navigate to: Mes achats (My Purchases)
- F12 → Console tab → Keep open

### Step 4: Execute The Test (5-10 minutes)

**In Tab A (Seller):**
1. Find a pending request (status = "pending")
2. Click the ACCEPTER button
3. Wait ~2 seconds

**In Tab B (Buyer):**
1. **WATCH THE CONSOLE** for these exact logs (in order):

```javascript
// First (should appear immediately):
✅ [REALTIME] CALLBACK TRIGGERED!

// Then (should appear ~1 second later):
✅ [LOAD] Purchase cases loaded: 1

// Then (should update automatically):
📋 [FILTER] ACCEPTED: [request-id] matches

// Then (UI updates):
Request moves from "Tous" tab to "Acceptées" tab
(You should see it slide to the right tab)
```

---

## 📊 Expected Results (All Should Pass)

### **Test Passes If:**

✅ **Console Log #1:** `🟢 [REALTIME] CALLBACK TRIGGERED!` appears  
✅ **Console Log #2:** `[LOAD] Purchase cases loaded: > 0` appears  
✅ **Console Log #3:** `[FILTER] ACCEPTED:` appears with request ID  
✅ **UI Update:** Request moves to "Acceptées" tab automatically  
✅ **Performance:** All updates happen within ~2 seconds  
✅ **No Page Refresh:** Page doesn't reload

### **Test Fails If:**

❌ Logs show: `[LOAD] Purchase cases loaded: 0` (still getting 0)  
❌ Logs show: `CHANNEL_ERROR` (subscription still broken)  
❌ No `🟢 [REALTIME] CALLBACK TRIGGERED!` log  
❌ Request stays in "Tous" tab (doesn't move)  
❌ Nothing changes after vendor accepts

## 📋 Detailed Checklist

As you run the test, verify:

- [ ] Tab A - Seller page loaded
- [ ] Tab B - Buyer page loaded
- [ ] Both F12 consoles open side-by-side
- [ ] Tab A shows pending requests
- [ ] Tab B shows "Tous" tab (all requests)
- [ ] Tab A - Click ACCEPTER on one request
- [ ] Tab B - Immediately look for console logs
- [ ] See: `🟢 [REALTIME] CALLBACK TRIGGERED!`
- [ ] See: `[LOAD] Purchase cases loaded: > 0`
- [ ] See: Request appears in "Acceptées" tab
- [ ] No errors in console
- [ ] No page refresh happened

If ALL checked: ✅ **SYNC IS WORKING!**

## 🔍 What Each Log Means

### `🟢 [REALTIME] CALLBACK TRIGGERED!`
**Meaning:** Real-time subscription is working!  
**What it means:** Vendor accepted → Database changed → Supabase fired event → Buyer's subscription received it  
**If missing:** Real-time still broken OR subscription canceled

### `[LOAD] Purchase cases loaded: 1+`
**Meaning:** Buyer can now query purchase_cases (RLS fixed!)  
**What it means:** Query succeeded, got data back  
**If shows 0:** RLS still blocking OR data doesn't exist

### `[FILTER] ACCEPTED: [id] matches`
**Meaning:** Filter logic working, identifying the correct tab  
**What it means:** Data is being processed correctly  
**If missing:** Filter logic issue

### Request moved to "Acceptées" tab
**Meaning:** UI updated with new data  
**What it means:** React state changed, component re-rendered  
**If doesn't happen:** UI not responding to state change

## 📞 If Something Goes Wrong

### Problem: Still seeing "[LOAD] Purchase cases loaded: 0"

**Troubleshooting:**
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (not just `F5`)
2. Verify policies exist: ✅ (you have 9 policies)
3. Check `buyer_id` column exists: 
   ```sql
   \d purchase_cases
   -- Look for: buyer_id column
   ```
4. Check auth.uid() is returning correct value:
   ```javascript
   // In console, paste:
   console.log('Current user ID:', (await supabase.auth.getSession()).data.session.user.id)
   ```
5. If still 0: Check that the request IDs match between requests and purchase_cases tables

### Problem: CHANNEL_ERROR still appears

**Troubleshooting:**
1. Dev server fully restarted? (kill and npm run dev)
2. Browser fully refreshed? (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check code was updated: 
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5
   # Should show: 60245a40 FIX: Real-time subscription
   ```
4. If commit not there: Changes weren't saved properly

### Problem: No callback triggered at all

**Troubleshooting:**
1. Vendor actually clicked ACCEPTER? (Not just hovering)
2. Buyer page is on "Mes achats"? (Not a different page)
3. Check browser console for any errors (red text)
4. Subscription was created? Look for: `🟢 [REALTIME] Creating subscription for buyer:`

---

## ✅ Success Path

If you see all these in order:
1. ✅ `🟢 [REALTIME] Subscription established successfully`
2. ✅ `🟢 [REALTIME] CALLBACK TRIGGERED!`
3. ✅ `[LOAD] Purchase cases loaded: 1+`
4. ✅ `[FILTER] ACCEPTED: [id] matches`
5. ✅ Request visually moves to "Acceptées" tab

**Then:** 🎉 **SYNC IS WORKING!**

---

## 🎯 After Test Passes

**Next Steps (If all checks pass):**

1. **Document Results:** Screenshot console showing `🟢 CALLBACK TRIGGERED!`
2. **Celebrate:** Real-time sync is now working! 🚀
3. **Move to Phase 2:**
   - Create ParticulierCaseTracking.jsx
   - Remove mock data
   - Verify database schema
   - End-to-end testing

**Estimated time for Phase 2:** 7-12 hours over 2-3 days

## 🎓 What RLS Policies Do

Each policy controls WHO can do WHAT with purchase_cases rows:

- **SELECT (read)** - Who can see rows?
  - Buyers see where `buyer_id = their ID`
  - Sellers see where `seller_id = their ID`
  - Admins see all

- **INSERT (create)** - Who can create rows?
  - Authenticated users can create
  - Sellers specifically can create
  - Others cannot

- **UPDATE (modify)** - Who can update rows?
  - Buyers can update their own
  - Sellers can update their own
  - Parties can update if involved

These were **missing before** → RLS blocked everything → Buyer got 0 rows
