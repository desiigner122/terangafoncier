## üöÄ QUICK START - 3 ESSENTIAL QUERIES

### Query 1: Check Transaction Completeness (COPY & PASTE)
```sql
-- Check how many transactions are incomplete
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_transactions,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN transaction_type IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as with_type,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN buyer_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as with_buyer,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN seller_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as with_seller,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN parcel_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as with_parcel,
  COUNT(CASE 
    WHEN transaction_type IS NOT NULL 
    AND buyer_id IS NOT NULL 
    AND seller_id IS NOT NULL 
    AND parcel_id IS NOT NULL 
    THEN 1 
  END) as complete_transactions
FROM transactions;
```

**Expected Result**: 
```
total_transactions: X
complete_transactions: X  ‚Üê Should match total_transactions
```

---

### Query 2: See Incomplete Transactions Details (COPY & PASTE)
```sql
-- See which transactions need fixing
SELECT 
  t.id,
  t.buyer_id,
  t.seller_id,
  t.parcel_id,
  t.transaction_type,
  t.status,
  r.parcel_id as request_parcel_id,
  r.user_id as request_user_id,
  p.seller_id as parcel_seller_id
FROM transactions t
LEFT JOIN requests r ON t.request_id = r.id
LEFT JOIN parcels p ON r.parcel_id = p.id
WHERE 
  t.transaction_type IS NULL 
  OR t.buyer_id IS NULL 
  OR t.seller_id IS NULL 
  OR t.parcel_id IS NULL
ORDER BY t.created_at DESC;
```

**What to look for**:
- ‚úÖ request_parcel_id has value? ‚Üí Copy to parcel_id
- ‚úÖ request_user_id has value? ‚Üí Copy to buyer_id
- ‚úÖ parcel_seller_id has value? ‚Üí Copy to seller_id

---

### Query 3: Fix All Incomplete Transactions (COPY & PASTE)
```sql
-- Fix transactions in one go
UPDATE transactions SET
  transaction_type = COALESCE(transaction_type, 'purchase'),
  buyer_id = COALESCE(buyer_id, r.user_id),
  seller_id = COALESCE(seller_id, p.seller_id),
  parcel_id = COALESCE(parcel_id, r.parcel_id)
FROM requests r
JOIN parcels p ON r.parcel_id = p.id
WHERE 
  transactions.request_id = r.id
  AND (
    transactions.transaction_type IS NULL 
    OR transactions.buyer_id IS NULL 
    OR transactions.seller_id IS NULL 
    OR transactions.parcel_id IS NULL
  );
```

**Result**: `UPDATE X` (X = number of rows fixed)

## üèóÔ∏è DATABASE SETUP - Execute These in Order

### Step 1: Create Workflow Tables
**File**: `create-workflow-tables.sql`
**Action**: Copy entire file content and paste into Supabase SQL Editor
**Result**: Should show "‚úÖ Tables workflow cr√©√©es avec succ√®s !"

---

### Step 2: Verify Data Integrity
**Paste this** to confirm no incomplete transactions remain:
```sql
-- Verify all transactions are now complete
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN COUNT(*) = COUNT(CASE WHEN transaction_type IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) THEN '‚úÖ All complete'
    ELSE '‚ùå ' || COUNT(*) - COUNT(CASE WHEN transaction_type IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) || ' incomplete'
  END as status
FROM transactions;
```
