## 🔴 Issue #1: Real-time Subscription Breaking

### **What Was Happening:**
```
Error: channel.unsubscribe is not a function
Subscription Status: CHANNEL_ERROR
```

### **Why:**
Code was using old Supabase API: `removeChannel()` which doesn't exist

### **Fix Applied:**
✅ **DONE** - Commit 60245a40  
Changed to: `channel().unsubscribe()`

### **Your Action:**
✅ Nothing needed - already fixed in code!

## 🔴 Issue #2: Buyer Can't Access purchase_cases Table

### **What's Happening:**
```
Buyer queries purchase_cases → Returns 0 rows
Vendor has 3 purchase_cases → Buyer blocked by RLS
```

### **Why:**
Row-Level Security (RLS) policy missing on database

### **Fix Needed:**
⏳ **YOU MUST** execute SQL in Supabase

### **Your Action (Next 2 Minutes):**

```bash
# Step 1: Open Supabase console
https://app.supabase.com → Select terangafoncier project

# Step 2: Go to SQL Editor
Left sidebar → SQL Editor → Create New Query

# Step 3: Copy and paste this:

ALTER TABLE public.purchase_cases ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Buyers can read their own purchase_cases"
  ON public.purchase_cases
  FOR SELECT
  USING (buyer_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Sellers can read their own purchase_cases"
  ON public.purchase_cases
  FOR SELECT
  USING (seller_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Sellers can create purchase_cases"
  ON public.purchase_cases
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (seller_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Sellers and Buyers can update their own purchase_cases"
  ON public.purchase_cases
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (seller_id = auth.uid() OR buyer_id = auth.uid())
  WITH CHECK (seller_id = auth.uid() OR buyer_id = auth.uid());

# Step 4: Click "Run" button
# Step 5: Wait for success message (should be instant)
```

**That's it!** SQL is applied.

---

## 🧪 After You Apply the SQL

### **Step 1: Restart Everything**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Kill dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Terminal 1: Restart dev server
npm run dev

# Browser: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
# Browser: Clear cookies/cache if needed
```

### **Step 2: Test Again**
```
1. Open 2 browser tabs
   - Tab A: Seller (heritage.fall@teranga-foncier.sn)
   - Tab B: Buyer (family.diallo@teranga-foncier.sn)

2. Both tabs: F12 → Console tab

3. Tab A: Go to Demandes, click ACCEPTER on a pending request

4. Tab B (BUYER): Watch the console for these logs:

   ✅ Look for: "🟢 [REALTIME] CALLBACK TRIGGERED!"
   ✅ Look for: "[LOAD] Purchase cases loaded: 1"
   ✅ Look for: Request moves to "Acceptées" tab

5. If you see all 3: ✅ SYNC IS WORKING!
```

---

## 📊 Before & After

### **BEFORE (Right Now - Broken):**
```
Buyer Console:
❌ [LOAD] Purchase cases loaded: 0
❌ [REALTIME] CALLBACK TRIGGERED! - never appears
❌ Request stays in "Tous" (All) tab

Result: Buyer sees nothing when vendor accepts
```

### **AFTER (After RLS SQL - Working):**
```
Buyer Console:
✅ [LOAD] Purchase cases loaded: 1+
✅ [REALTIME] CALLBACK TRIGGERED! - appears immediately
✅ Request moves to "Acceptées" tab automatically

Result: Buyer sees accepted request in real-time
```

## ⏱️ Timeline

```
📋 NOW (You're reading this)
   └─ ~30 seconds

🔧 Apply SQL Fix
   └─ 2 minutes (in Supabase console)

🔄 Restart Dev Server
   └─ 30 seconds

🧪 Test Sync
   └─ 5-10 minutes

## 🎯 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see in buyer's console:

```javascript
✅ "🟢 [REALTIME] CALLBACK TRIGGERED!"
✅ "[LOAD] Purchase cases loaded: 1"
✅ Request moves from "Tous" to "Acceptées" tab
✅ No page refresh needed (live update)
✅ Happens within ~1 second of vendor accepting
```

## ❌ If Something Goes Wrong

### **Problem: "Policy already exists" error**
```sql
-- Solution: Drop and re-create
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Buyers can read their own purchase_cases" 
  ON public.purchase_cases;
-- Then run the CREATE POLICY again
```

### **Problem: Still seeing "Purchase cases loaded: 0"**
```
1. Hard refresh browser: Ctrl+Shift+R
2. Clear all cookies
3. Check column name is "buyer_id" (not "purchaser_id")
4. Verify auth.uid() returns the right user ID
5. Re-run test
```

### **Problem: "CHANNEL_ERROR" still appearing**
```
1. Verify dev server was fully restarted
2. Kill: Ctrl+C
3. Wait 2 seconds
4. Run: npm run dev again
5. Hard refresh browser
```

## 🚀 After This Works - Next Steps

Once you verify the sync is working (you see the callback trigger):

1. **Create Case Tracking Page** (3-5 hours)
   - Mirror: VendeurCaseTracking.jsx for buyers
   - Show: Case number, status, documents

2. **Remove Mock Data** (2-3 hours)
   - Notifications
   - Messages
   - Replace with real database queries

3. **Verify Database Schema** (1-2 hours)
   - Check all required tables exist
   - Check all required columns exist

4. **Full End-to-End Test** (1-2 hours)
   - Make offer → Seller sees → Accept → Buyer sees
   - All with real data, no mocks

**Total remaining work: 7-12 hours over 2-3 days**

## 📞 Key Information

**What Changed Today:**
- ✅ `src/services/RealtimeSyncService.js` - Fixed API calls
- ⏳ `purchase_cases` table RLS policies - Needs SQL execution

**What Stays The Same:**
- UI components (no changes needed)
- Data structures (no migrations needed)
- Frontend logic (works as-is)

**What's Ready:**
- SQL fix file: `FIX_RLS_PURCHASE_CASES.sql`
- Full documentation: 4 detailed guides
- Test procedure: Clear step-by-step instructions

**What's Needed From You:**
- Execute SQL (2 minutes)
- Restart dev server (30 seconds)
- Test and report (5 minutes)

## 💡 Learning: Why RLS Matters

**RLS (Row-Level Security):**
- Database-level security
- Filters queries before they reach app
- Returns empty results if policy blocks access
- No error is thrown (silent blocking)

**This Was The Root Cause:**
- Data existed in database ✓
- Vendor could see it (had permission) ✓
- Buyer queried for it ✓
- RLS policy blocked it at DB level ✓
- Query returned 0 rows ✓
- Frontend saw 0 rows and showed nothing ✓

**That's Why Debug Was Hard:**
- No error in frontend code
- No error in console
- Just silent 0 rows
- Data clearly exists (vendor sees it)
- Classic RLS policy issue

3. Test (5-10 min)
4. Report results
5. Next phase ready!
